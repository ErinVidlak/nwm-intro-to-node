# Demo: Using Templates with Express

## Objective
Learn how to integrate template engines with Express to render dynamic HTML content from the server.

## Introduction to Template Engines
Template engines allow you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easy to design an HTML interface and simultaneously enable dynamic content generation based on server-side logic.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Express App
Ensure you have a basic Express application running. If not, set up a new one following the initial setup demos.

## Step 2: Install a Template Engine
For this demo, we'll use EJS, which is a popular JavaScript template engine. To install EJS, run:

```bash
npm install ejs
```

## Step 3: Configure Express to Use EJS
Set up your application to use EJS as its template engine:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// Set the view engine to ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs')

// Set the directory where the template files are located
app.set('views', './views')
```

## Step 4: Create a Template
Create a new directory named `views` and add an EJS file named `index.ejs`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome <%= name %>!</h1>
    <p>This is a dynamic page rendered by Express using EJS.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Step 5: Create a Route to Render the Template
Add a route that renders the `index.ejs` template when visited:

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.render('index', { name: 'Visitor' })  // Pass data to the template
})
```

## Step 6: Test Your Application
Run your application and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the HTML page generated by the template, displaying a personalized greeting.
